## Description
A full-stack fitness tracker app built with Express and MongoDB. This app allows users to create custom logs of resistance and cardio exercises: names, durations, weights, sets, reps, and more! The app also serves handy graphs and charts in a sleek and simple front-end UI, so any workout-aholic can easily track their exercise routines and daily progress on specific workouts.
    
## Installation
For developers: simply clone this repository and run ```npm run seed``` to seed the workout database with some sample workout data. From there, the server can be watched via nodemon. Morgan npm is also installed and ready to go for easy logging.
